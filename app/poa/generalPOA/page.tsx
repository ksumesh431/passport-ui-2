            A General Power of Attorney (GPA) is a legal document that grants an individual (the "agent" or "attorney-in-fact")
            the authority to act on behalf of another person (the "principal") in a variety of financial, legal, or personal matters.
            The principal grants this authority to the agent, allowing them to make decisions and take actions on the principal's
            behalf when they are unable or unavailable to do so themselves.
