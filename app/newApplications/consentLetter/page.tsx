                    Traveling outside Canada with children often requires a Consent Letter, especially if only one parent, guardians, or other relatives are accompanying the child. A properly drafted and legally binding consent letter ensures that the child's travel is safe, authorized, and hassle-free. At DocoAid, we specialize in preparing and notarizing consent letters for children traveling internationally, ensuring that your family's travel experience is smooth and worry-free.

                            When a child is traveling abroad with one parent or a third party, a Consent Letter serves as legal proof that the other parent or legal guardians have granted permission for the child to travel. This is a requirement for border officials, airlines, and other authorities in many countries, especially when the child is under 18.
